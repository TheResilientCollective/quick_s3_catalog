# Feature Specification: FR-009 Task Creation for Download Links

**Feature Branch**: `002-fr-009-needs`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "fr-009 needs to be created as a task how do i tell you to do that"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A project maintainer needs to ensure that FR-009 (downloadable links to dataset distributions) from the S3 Dataset Catalog Browser specification has corresponding implementation tasks in the tasks.md file. Currently, this functional requirement exists in the specification but lacks task coverage, creating a gap between requirements and implementation planning.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** FR-009 exists in the specification without corresponding tasks, **When** the project maintainer reviews task coverage, **Then** they can identify the missing task and request its creation
2. **Given** a missing task for FR-009 is identified, **When** the maintainer creates the task specification, **Then** the task includes clear implementation steps for providing downloadable links to dataset distributions
3. **Given** the new task is added to tasks.md, **When** implementation begins, **Then** developers have clear guidance on implementing download link functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple functional requirements lack task coverage?
- How should task creation be prioritized when requirements have interdependencies?
- What occurs when a functional requirement is too broad and needs to be broken into multiple tasks?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a mechanism for identifying functional requirements that lack corresponding implementation tasks
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable creation of implementation tasks that map directly to functional requirements
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to specify task details including description, dependencies, and implementation scope
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure new tasks integrate properly with existing task ordering and dependencies
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that task descriptions provide sufficient implementation guidance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Functional Requirement**: A testable specification of system behavior that requires implementation
- **Implementation Task**: A specific work item that contributes to fulfilling one or more functional requirements
- **Task Dependency**: A relationship between tasks that defines execution order constraints
- **Task Coverage Mapping**: The association between functional requirements and their corresponding implementation tasks
