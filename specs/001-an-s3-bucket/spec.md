# Feature Specification: S3 Dataset Catalog Browser

**Feature Branch**: `001-an-s3-bucket`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "an s3 bucket listing of data stored in the bucket. The bucket contains data files, and metadata.json files which contain schema.org Dataset descriptions. I would like to display the dataset descriptions, make them searchable, a javascript library should do it, and have them ordered."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: What search capabilities should users have when finding datasets? ‚Üí A: Text search across title and description fields only
- Q: How should datasets be ordered for users to browse effectively? ‚Üí A: Organized by top-level folder sections (data, health, tijuana) with expandable sections
- Q: What is an acceptable loading time for the dataset catalog? ‚Üí A: Speed is not essential
- Q: What access control should the catalog have? ‚Üí A: Public access - anyone can view datasets
- Q: Which schema.org Dataset properties should be displayed to users? ‚Üí A: Standard metadata (title, description, creator, dateCreated) with dataset distributions as download links

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A data analyst wants to discover and explore datasets stored in S3 buckets. They need to quickly browse through available datasets, understand what each dataset contains through schema.org metadata descriptions, search for datasets by specific criteria, and view them in a meaningful order to find the most relevant data for their analysis work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an S3 bucket containing data files and metadata.json files, **When** a user accesses the catalog browser, **Then** they see a list of all datasets with their schema.org descriptions displayed
2. **Given** multiple datasets are displayed, **When** a user enters search terms, **Then** the list filters to show only datasets matching the search criteria
3. **Given** a list of datasets, **When** the catalog loads, **Then** the datasets are organized by top-level folder sections (data, health, tijuana) with expandable sections
4. **Given** a dataset has missing or malformed metadata.json, **When** the catalog loads, **Then** the dataset appears with an indication that metadata is unavailable
5. **Given** a dataset with distributions, **When** a user views the dataset details, **Then** they see download links for accessing the actual data files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when metadata.json files are missing or contain invalid schema.org data?
- How does the system handle S3 access permissions errors?
- What occurs when an S3 bucket contains thousands of datasets?
- How does the system behave when metadata files exist but corresponding data files are missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST scan S3 bucket contents and identify data files with corresponding metadata.json files
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse schema.org Dataset descriptions from metadata.json files
- **FR-003**: System MUST display dataset information including title, description, creator, and dateCreated from schema.org metadata
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide downloadable links to dataset distributions (data files) for user access
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to search datasets by text matching against dataset title and description fields
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize datasets by top-level folder sections (data, health, tijuana) with expandable/collapsible sections
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle datasets with missing or invalid metadata gracefully
- **FR-007**: System performance requirements are flexible with no specific timing constraints
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide public access allowing anyone to view datasets without authentication

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Dataset**: Represents a collection of data files in S3 with associated schema.org metadata, including properties like title, description, creator, creation date, and data format
- **Metadata**: Schema.org Dataset description stored in metadata.json files, containing structured information about the dataset's content and provenance
- **S3 Object**: Individual files in the S3 bucket, either data files or metadata.json files, with properties like key, size, and last modified date
